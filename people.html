                <figcaption>96% of the population face high levels of acute food insecurity. Approximately 100 Palestinians, including 42 children, have died due to severe malnutrition.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Constant bombardment and displacement and the loss of family members are predisposing many children to anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and other adverse mental health conditions. In fact, a <strong>2020</strong> study showed that 53·5% of Gazan children had PTSD even before this conflict.</p>

            <h3>Faris Odeh</h3>

            <p>Ten days later, on 8 November, Odeh was again throwing stones at Karni when he was shot in the neck by an Israeli soldier.</p>
            <p>His friends say that as Odeh crouched to pick up a stone, he was hit in the neck and that because he was so close to an Israeli tank that they had to wait an hour before they felt it was safe to remove his body and load it into an ambulance. He was pronounced dead upon arrival at the hospital.</p>

            <p>Hind Rajab (May 2018 – 29 January 2024) was a five-year-old Palestinian girl in the Gaza Strip who was killed by Israeli forces, during the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip, which also killed six of her family members and two paramedics coming to her rescue.</p>
            <p>Rajab and her family were fleeing Gaza City when their vehicle was shelled, killing her uncle, aunt and three cousins, except for Rajab and another cousin who contacted the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) to ask for help while noting that they were being attacked by an Israeli tank.</p>
            <img src="images/people/Children/hind-car-destroyed.jpg" alt="A photo of the car that Hind and her family were killed in.">

            <p>The cousin, 15-year-old Layan, was later also killed and Rajab was left stranded in the vehicle for hours on the phone, as paramedics from PRCS attempted to rescue her. Both Rajab and the paramedics were later also found killed on 10 February after an Israeli withdrawal.</p>
            <p>The car had been hit by 335 bullets.</p>

            <p>The audio of the phone call between the PRCS, Hamadeh and Rajab was published by the Red Crescent on 3 February.</p>

            <p>"Israel's war on Gaza is more deadly to journalists than any previous war". Israeli airstrikes additionally damaged or destroyed an estimated 48 media facilities in Gaza. Reporters Without Borders has reported that the Israeli army intentionally targeted Palestinian and Lebanese journalists.</p>

            <h3>The Killing of Journalists' Families</h3>
            <p>On 4 December, nine family members of CNN producer Ibrahim Dahman were killed in an Israeli airstrike in northern Gaza. On 11 December, an airstrike on the home of journalist Anas al-Sharif resulted in the death of his father.[73] On 8 January 2024, the mother of Al Arabiya journalist Ahmad al-Batta, and the wife and children of journalist Sameer Radi, were killed in airstrikes.[74] The Palestinian Journalists Syndicate stated on 4 February that 70 journalists had lost close family members.[75] On 28 February, a Palestinian journalist stated that an Israeli bombing had killed his pregnant wife, three-year-old son, and 20 other people.[76] Hussein Jaber, an UNRWA photographer, stated that his five-year-old daughter was killed while his family was evacuating Gaza City in December 2023, stating, "Heavy gunfire broke out, and I saw how Salma was hit in the neck in front of my eyes".</p>
            <img src="images/people/Journalists/wael-dahdouh.webp" alt="Wael, media chief, mourns a family member">
            <p>Several members of the family of Al Jazeera Arabic's Gaza bureau chief Wael Dahdouh were killed in an Israeli airstrike on 25 October in the Nuseirat refugee camp, south of Wadi Gaza, where they had been sheltering after following the Israeli order for Palestinian civilians to move south from northern Gaza. Al Jazeera condemned the killings, calling it an "indiscriminate attack". Dahdouh, speaking to Al Jazeera, said "There is no safe place in Gaza at all". The Israeli army confirmed it had conducted an airstrike in the area near where Dahdouh's family had been sheltering, saying they were targeting "Hamas terrorist infrastructure". Dahdouh himself was later injured in an Israeli missile strike in Khan Younis while covering the Haifa School airstrike.</p>
            <p>Dahdouh's son Hamza al-Dahdouh, also a journalist, was killed with a colleague by an Israeli airstrike on their vehicle in Khan Younis on 7 January 2024. Reporters Without Borders stated it appeared a single rocket had fallen on Dahdouh's car. The IDF said that the pair were traveling with a "terror operative" who was operating a drone and that they "identified and struck a terrorist who operated an aircraft in a way that put IDF forces at risk". According to the Washington Post, the IDF changed their statement the following day, when IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said that their use of a drone to film made them appear to be terrorists. After a March 2024 investigation, The Washington Post concluded that there were "no indications" that Dahdouh had been "operating as anything other than a journalist that day" because experts said there was no evidence of any "military deployments or militant activity" in the vicinity of the rubble that eleven journalists had traveled from Rafah to report on after an Israeli airstrike earlier in the day. In a statement, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken stated he was "deeply sorry" for the "unimaginable loss". Wael Dahdouh stated, "Hamza was not part of me. He was all of me."</p>

                <figcaption>Adnan Al-Bursh (17 September 1974 – c. 19 April 2024) was a Palestinian orthopedic surgeon and the head of orthopedics at the Gaza Strip's largest medical facility, Al-Shifa Hospital.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>On 5 December 2023, the IDF surrounded Al-Awda Hospital in North Gaza where Al-Bursh was temporarily working. The hospital director told him that staff would have to leave the building. According to a doctor who worked with him there, the IDF would destroy the hospital if all the male workers did not exit.[10] Israeli forces arrested the 50-year-old doctor alongside 10 other workers.</p>
            <p>Palestinian authorities and advocacy groups have attributed his death to torture or mistreatment in custody. Released prisoners told Al-Bursh's family that he was being subjected to torture, and a UN statement on his death confirmed his body showed signs of torture. According to a deposition provided to HaMoked, an Israeli human rights organization, by a prisoner who knew Al-Bursh, he was injured upon his arrival at Ofer in mid-April and was "naked in the lower part of his body". The deposition said that guards threw him down in the yard and left him there, unable to stand up, and that he died shortly after being helped to a room by prisoners. The IPS denied these events.</p>
