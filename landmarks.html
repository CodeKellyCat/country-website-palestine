                    <figcaption>The Great Mosque of Gaza, also known as the Great Omari Mosque, was the largest and oldest mosque in all of Gaza, Palestine, located in Gaza City.</figcaption>
                    <p>
                        According to tradition, the mosque stands on the site of the Philistine temple dedicated to Dagon—the god of fertility—which Samson toppled in the Book of Judges. Later, a temple dedicated to Marnas—god of rain and grain—was erected. Local legend today claims that Samson is buried under the present mosque.

                        In 2023 it was destroyed by an Israeli airstrike, leaving most of the structure collapsed and the minaret partially destroyed.

It served as a seat of power in the Mamluk and Ottoman periods and as a police station during the British Mandate.</figcaption>

                    <figcaption>The Church of Saint Porphyrius is a Greek Orthodox church in Gaza City. It belongs to the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem and is the oldest active church in the city. Located in the Zaytun Quarter of the Old City of Gaza, it is named after the 5th-century bishop of Gaza, Saint Porphyrius, whose tomb is situated in the northeastern corner of the church.</figcaption>
                    <p>
                        In the 2014 Gaza War, around 2,000 Palestinians slept in the church during Israeli bombings. The church was again used as refuge for hundreds of civilians during the 2023–24 Israeli invasion. In October 2023, it was the site of an airstrike by the Israeli Air Force, which hit two halls sheltering Gazan Palestinian Muslims and Christians, causing the collapse of at least one building, and killed between 16–18 civilians.[16] The church was attacked again in July 2024.

                    <p>
                        Some parts of the city wall until recently were still standing, and port structures visible. Archaeologists have discovered a Roman-era cemetery dubbed Ard al-Moharbeen Necropolis, with over 100 graves including ornate tombs in which coins for passage to the underworld were placed inside the mouths of the deceased.</p>

                        <p>
                            During the 2023 Israel invasion, the  (Anthedon) site was listed by a cultural heritage preservation report as completely destroyed by direct shelling.

                    <figcaption>Tell es-Sakan ('Hill of Ash') is a tell (archaeological mound) about 5 km south of Gaza City in what is today the Gaza Strip, on the northern bank of Wadi Ghazzeh.[1] It was the site of two separate Early Bronze Age urban settlements: an earlier one representing the fortified administrative center of the Egyptian colonies in southwestern Palestine from the end of the 4th millennium, and a later, local Canaanite fortified city of the third millennium.</figcaption>
                    <p>Hundreds of cultural heritage sites were destroyed or damaged during the 2023 Israeli invasion of Gaza, including Tell es-Sakan. Analysis of satellite imagery by GAZAMAP found that residential buildings in the vicinity of Tell es-Sakan had been destroyed.[36] The archaeological site was damaged, and as of November 2023 the extent was uncertain.[</p>

                    <figcaption>The Bureij mosaic is a Byzantine-era mosaic floor discovered under an olive orchard in the Bureij refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, Palestine in 2022.</figcaption>
                    <p>The mosaic was likely created between AD 390 and 634–636. It is described as a "sprawling grid" with cartouches containing 17 animals, including geese, ducks, dogs, insects, goats, deer, and an octopus. There are also geometric patterns and a border depicting a vine. The mosaic underlies a 500-square-metre (5,400 sq ft) area from which three sections of earth have already been removed, with more remaining to be excavated</p>
                    <p>Farmer Salman al-Nabahin found the mosaic when he began investigating why his trees were not rooting properly. The French Biblical and Archaeological School of Jerusalem is assisting with the excavation. Archaeologist Rene Elter reported that the mosaic was in a "perfect state of conservation". Further research is needed to determine whether the mosaic floor was installed in a private villa, a religious structure, or for some other purpose.</p>

                    <p>Before the Israeli invasion of Gaza, the Erez Crossing, in the north of the Gaza Strip, used to be the only crossing point for people and goods coming from Israel into the Gaza Strip. A second crossing point, the Kerem Shalom border crossing, is used exclusively for goods coming from Egypt as Israel did not allow goods to go directly from Egypt into Gaza through the Egypt–Gaza border.</p>
                    <pIt includes a 7-meter wall with sensors, remote-control machine guns and barbed wire in the three areas where the border runs adjacent to Israeli settlements></p>
